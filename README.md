# GENA
GENA (Geophysical ExploratioN data Automation)

The main objection of the GENA software is to provide an easy to use Geoscience Data Management Package with the additional tools:
 1. import of raw interumentation, 
 2. quality control of the raw data.
 3. data locate the instrument data, 
 4. 2D/3D visualisation, 
 5. 2D/3D numerical modelling,
 6. Interpretation Tools,
 7. and the "Holy Grail", Automatic Reportings!

As the main contributor, my code has evolved from PC BASIC code in the 1980s, to UNIX/PC FOTRAN code in the 1990s, to .NET C# and C++ code at present.
GENA evolved from an earlier version called GEOSPACE and stayed proprietory up until this date 19 SEPT 2017.

This Version is set back to beta version from an internal Version 5.
