# GENA
GENA (Geophysical ExploratioN data Automation)

The main objection of the GENA software is to provide an easy to use Geoscience Data Management Package with the additional tools:

 1. Import of raw instrumentation data, 
 2. Quality control of the raw data.
 3. Data locate the instrument data, 
 4. 2D/3D visualisation, 
 5. 2D/3D numerical modelling,
 6. Interpretation Tools,
 7. GENA Strap-ons - enable community libraries to add to GENA's tools.
 8. and last but not least the "Holy Grail" of every Geoscientist, Automatic Reports!

As the main contributor, my code has evolved from PC BASIC code in the 1980s, to UNIX/PC FOTRAN code in the 1990s, to .NET C# and C++ code at present.

GENA evolved from an earlier version called GEOSPACE and stayed proprietory up until this date 19 SEPT 2017. Other third-party libraries and contributors are Acknoledged and valid licencing checked.

This Version 0.1 is set back to beta version from an internal Version 5.
